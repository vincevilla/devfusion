As of 2015, there were 238 ABET-accredited computer engineering programs in the US. In Europe, accreditation of computer engineering schools is done by a variety of agencies part of the EQANIE network. Due to increasing job requirements for engineers who can concurrently design hardware, software, firmware, and manage all forms of computer systems used in industry, some tertiary institutions around the world offer a bachelor's degree generally called computer engineering. Both computer engineering and electronic engineering programs include analog and digital circuit design in their curriculum. As with most engineering disciplines, having a sound knowledge of mathematics and science is necessary for computer engineers.</b>

This article exploresthe establishment of computer engineering as a distinct field orspecialty, primarily in the context of professional societies and privatesector firms.With more than 70,000 computer hardwareengineers working professionally and morethan 200 computer engineering bachelor’sdegree programs accredited by ABET, the ex-istence of computer engineering as a distinctprofessional specialty in the United States iseasily taken for granted.1,2Yet the contempo-rary vitality of the field tells little of its ori-gins.Howdidwecometohavepeopletrained and employed as computer engi-neers? What counts as computer engineeringknowledge and practice? How is computerengineering related to other technical fields?And how have these things varied over timeand in different contexts? This study beginsaddressing such questions through the inves-tigation of the field’s early history, therebymaking a contribution to a historical litera-ture that has largely overlooked the topic.</b>
